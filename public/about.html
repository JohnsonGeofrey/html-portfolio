<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Johnson Geofrey, a junior web developer with a passion for technology and innovation in the healthcare sector. 
  I hold a degree in Medicine from Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, where my journey into the world of technology began. 
  Currently, I am honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap, and jQuery, alongside web design principles like UI and UX. 
  My growing expertise in the Document Object Model (DOM) empowers me to build interactive and user-friendly websites,
   and I am driven by a desire to merge these skills with my medical background to create impactful digital solutions.</p>

<p>My interest in technology is deeply rooted in the ongoing digital transformation of healthcare. 
  Witnessing the rise of telemedicine, digital pharmacies, and other tech-driven healthcare solutions in our country inspired me to pivot towards tech. 
  I am particularly fascinated by the integration of AI and data science in healthcare, 
  as I believe these innovations have the power to revolutionize patient care and optimize healthcare systems globally. 
  My goal is to contribute to this evolving field by leveraging my medical knowledge and tech skills to develop groundbreaking solutions that disrupt traditional healthcare models.</p>

<p>Outside of my professional pursuits, I am an adventurous spirit who thrives on exploring new challenges and stepping out of my comfort zone.
   I enjoy playing football, swimming, hiking, and diving, and I am always eager to try new activities, even those that seem risky.
    My adventurous nature fuels my creativity and resilience, qualities that I bring to every project I work on. 
    As I continue to build my expertise in web development, I am excited about the future of health tech and look forward to fully immersing myself in the tech industry,
     where I can blend my skills to make a meaningful impact.</p>
